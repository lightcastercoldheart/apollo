Parent Guides

  - Parent guides are the first guides made from a specified keyword. They will appear as the topmost guide when their specific keyword
  is being searched. A copy of the parent guide will be made when users choose to base off of it and make some edits/modifications. The
  edited guides will also be stacked as a child under the parent guide.
  
Child

  - A child guide is a modification of the parent guide it is stacked under. Child guides contain the modification information to show
  how it is different from its previous guide. The child guide can become a parent guide when a copy of it is modified.

Endles Stacking System

  - Stacking can be done endlessly as long as a modification is made on the parent guide.
